<li><strong>Chirping.</strong> Very good. Almost always confuses any new humans nearby.</li>
<li><strong>Plaintive wail.</strong> This is an excellent way to let your humans know that you have seen the bottom of your food bowl and its horrible emptyness will surely infect your soul should they not refill your crunchies immediately. Also fun to wail for no discernable reason at all.</li>
<li><strong>Burbles.</strong> Burbles are my favorite. The absolute best noise there is. Use burbles to let your roomates know that you are so full of thoughts and ideas you can&#39;t help but mutter them to yourself as you stroll through the house. Also keep the houseplants guessing.</li>
<li><strong>Meow</strong>. Classic. Timeless. Perfect.</li>
<li><strong>Hiss</strong>. My best-friend-sister-soulmate smelled a little funny today so instead of cuddles we played &quot;hiss at eachother like strangers&quot;. It wasn&#39;t as fun as I thought it might be. Sorry, Artemis.</li>
